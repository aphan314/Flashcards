## Lab 4

### App Description
Flash Cards App allows users to input questions and answers. On the tap of the question label, the screen will show the answer. To return to the question, the user simply has to tap on the answer label. There is a multiple choice option in which the back side of the flashcard will display only if the user taps on the correct answer. If the user would like to create a new flashcard, he or she would tap on the '+' button which navigates to a different view. The user can either cancel out of the creation view by tapping the 'Cancel' button or input a new question along with the corresponding answer. Once the user has entered in a new question and answer in the textboxes, he or she can display the flashcard by tapping on the 'Done' button and it will navigate back to the main view which is now updated with the new flashcard. If there is no text written in the text field, then the app will display an error message. User can also edit existing flashcard by clicking the pencil button. The user can flip through multiple flashcards using the Prev and Next buttons. When the re-opening the Flash Cards App, the user can see the previously created flashcards that were saved to the disk. 

With the help from CodePath, Flash Cards App was developed using Xcode and code was written in Swift.
